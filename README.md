# Flutter Boilerplate

My default boilerplate for Flutter projects with code generation.

## Getting started
Check the requirements and install everything what is missing.
If you don't need the code generation you can ignore mason.

Makefile commands ```make help```
Code generation ```mason list```

## Requirements
- flutter
- dart
- make - Used for combining multiple commands.
- mason_cli: ```dart pub global activate mason_cli```

## Latest Flutter & Dart version
```
$ flutter doctor --version
